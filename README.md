Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
Yes.

Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
Not quite, still going bakc and forth to edit some of the existing data.

Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
I have tried to do regression neural network, however it seems like the mse is still very high, thus I am still working on it. I plan to use XGBoost too, but seem to have some trouble installing xgboost at the moment.

What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
Currently, I am having modeling difficulties in terms of accuracy and installing. I will GOOGLE, and also adjust my features.

Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
Nope.

What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?
Finish up the EDA and complete modeling. To start on conclusion and analysis.

What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?
Ways I can improve on the project, more modelling methods for regression.
